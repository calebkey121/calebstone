# Calebstone
This game is purely for personal edification
In order to learn more about python, github, OOP, GUI, among others, I decided to replicate the popular game Hearthstone by Blizzard
The first line of code was written 5/13/20 locally until I uploaded everything to GitHub on 5/17/20
The goal for now is to replicate the game of Hearthstone in python, and implement it to Tkinter
