# Calebstone

## Project Background

Calebstone is a personal project developed to deepen understanding of Python, GitHub, object-oriented programming, and game development using Pygame. This project, inspired by Blizzard's Hearthstone, began as a learning tool and has evolved into a unique game with its own features and mechanics. The first line of code was written on May 13, 2020. The initial goal was to replicate Hearthstone's gameplay but the project has since taken its own direction.
