Preface
    Creating this game to be my own, rather than a Hearthstone copy, sounds more fulfilling.
    Core Mechanics that I want:
        - Card/Deck based game
        - Heros to act as the player that have special abilities, more interesting and impactful than 'hero powers'
        - Need a goal to end the game, easy one is to kill the enemy hero. (consider alternatives)
        - Must be a resource (I want to call it gold) required to play cards. 
        - I want to go away from the way mana works (get one more mana a turn, cap at 20)
        - Spend gold to call in allies, buy equipment, take actions (spells)
            These specific things may change, but spending gold to cast cards will not
        - Must have an area where Allies, and other things, are in-play (the board)
        - Basic allies (characters on the board) have an attack and health

    Resources Rethought
        - Mana allows playing cards, 1 additional mana each turn, max of 10, lose mana not spent
        - Income, get a certain amount of gold per turn
        - Bounties, ex. first to kill x enemy allies gets a boon
        - Create a baseline for gold to stat cost of cards ex. 5 gold buys 10 stats baseline


Equipment Slots (random idea)
    - Have a certain amount of slots that determine how much equipment a hero can have
    - ex 10 slots, equiping a sword takes up 2 slots, certain armor takes anywhere from 3-5 slots
    cons
    - Dont like because playing a strong card that never leaves might be crazy
    - might take a ton of the screen to view
        can have a weapon and armor symbol that pulls up the card when selected
    pros
    - feels like youre powering up your hero

Swarm (random Idea)
    - able to choose to add stats to another swarm ally, or play individually on the board
    

    Maybe instead of a lot of slots, you have two slots for weapon and armor
        can equip low cost, low impact or high cost, high impact equipment
        can have mechanics interecting with equipment
        can have equipment to distinguish unique playstyle from other games

1) Refactor Code
    - Go through existing code to determine if it needs to change structure
    - Comment, comment, comment
    - Delete unused functions
    - Update README
    - Delete unused files (main.py, simulator.py, tools.py?)
    - Determine if we actually need the classes we have
    
2) Deck 
    - Instead of importing a .txt, maybe have a python file that creates a bunch of Card objs
    - Create deck objs in the deck file and import them into the hero file

3) Heros
    - Create heros and choose a hero to play
    - Give heros predetermined cards
    - later on we can choose a hero and then choose cards, for now we can make a hero and give them cards
    - Create hero objs in the hero file, using the deck objs in the deck file

4) GameManager
    Big Question: should GameManager == WindowManager? Should the game and the graphics be handled in this same class?
    a) Start Screen
        - Title
        - Start Game (Main Menu)
        - Exit Game
    b) Main Menu
        - Choose Hero
        - Choose Enemy Hero
        - Start Game (Actual Game)
    c) End Screen
        - Display Winner
        - Rematch Option
        - Main Menu Option

5) Cool things to add
    a) Actions (Spells)
        - different than ally, but still a card
        - should look like, but different than an ally
        - needs text to describe the spell effect
        Card Ideas with increasing difficulty
            1) 5 gold, deal 5 damage

    b) Simulator
        - Runs random v random game
        - Can run as many games as asked
        - Documents the results of the games (might be useful to look back at archive calebstone for this task)
            ex. winner/loser, heros, who went first, log of the game
        
    c) Game Log
        - Documents Actions taken within the game
        - Can be viewed in game to look back on what exactly happened

    d) Visual Effects
        - I'm thinking simple for now, of course. Following tasks are assumed to be simple
        - Arrows to point from source, to target
        - Damage indication (ex. 3/2 attacks 4/4, 3/2 takes 4 dmg and such is indicated, 4/4 takes 3 dmg and such is indicated)
        - Death indication (ex. 3/2 attacks 4/4, 3/2 dies and such is indicated)
