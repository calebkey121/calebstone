"""
Purpose:
    This class manages the game flow and game logic. It controls what happens during a player’s turn and resolves interactions between players, allies, heroes, etc.
Responsibilities:
    Run the main game loop, switching between players and calling methods on GameState and the Player class.
    Resolve actions: When a player performs an action (play card, attack), the GameManager ensures it’s valid and calls the appropriate methods on the game state and players.
    Handle inter-player interactions (e.g., Player 1 attacking Player 2’s ally).
Notes:
    The GameManager orchestrates the game flow but doesn’t hold the game state directly (that’s the job of GameState).
    It interacts with the Player class and GameState to execute actions, but it doesn’t modify state directly—this is done via the player methods (play_card(), take_damage(), etc.).
