This game is so funny... I code up some new features for a couple weeks, then don't touch it for a year. 
I've been on and off for four years now, probably a couple months of 'continuous' time spent in total. 
It's great to read code years after writing it. I see all these mistakes that I made, but they're not
bad mistakes... just not prefered. What I mean is that I wrote good code cuz it works, not because it was
properly written or structured. It was put together in a good enough way that looking back over it I know
what I was going for and I've learned since on better ways to do it. I already fixed a couple of things that
really bothered me, but the reality is that I wrote a really cool game, and there's no reason that I should
have stopped or taken a break like I did... More what I mean is that I worry WAY TOO MUCH about how good 
the code is that I write. Just sit down and write it!!!! Come back later and learn from your mistakes!!!
